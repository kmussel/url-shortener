Well first off I'm not a graphic designer so try not to judge me to harshly on the looks :)

I used Ruby on Rails with React and Postgres. 

I set it up as an API with the front-end as a consumer.  If it was a high traffic site then all 
the static assets could be served separately (like from an S3 bucket).

I used Postgres simply because it was quick to setup but a NoSQL database like Dynamodb would be a good solution
here since the data is key/value pairs. 

I setup Github Actions for CI/CD.  The CD part is just mocked but it will build the docker image, lint and run tests.

The initial testing is setup for both javascript and rails.  

The README contains the setup instructions.
